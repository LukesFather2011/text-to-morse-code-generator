A simple text-to-morse code converter in the console. Includes all letters in the english language along with punctuations.

In the future I will try to incorporate a morse to text converter.

I completed this project for Day 82 of 100 Days of Code by Dr. Angela Yu, on udemy.com. I had a lot of fun with this course, and now
I will be slowly creating each of the portfolio projects. 

If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions for things to incorporate features, feel free to reach out!
